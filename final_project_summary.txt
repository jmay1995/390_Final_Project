\cf0 For our final project, we decided to gather and explore data from the band, Phish.  In doing so, two of our main resources were phish.net and phish.in.  We began by scraping the APIs from the websites to gather information on the songs, dates, tours, locations, venues, and much more to culminate into a huge dataset, phanalytix.csv, comprising of 31 variables and 30,883 observations.  As we did not begin the project with a particular question in mind, but rather with the goal of exploring the data to find out more about the band, we began our exploratory data analysis with our goal of doing \'93Phanalytix\'94, an analysis on Phish.  The three of us dove into different parts of the data, each coming up with different plots and findings.  This part of our project was interesting as Rachel and Aish lacked the expertise and knowledge base of the band, but Joe, being a hardcore fan, though to explore different parts of the data to gain deeper understanding.  While Rachel and Aish explored the general data, Joe dove into the specifics, such as teases of songs, etc, giving more ideas for different parts of the data to be explored.  We understood the importance of having a good knowledge base in the area to do analysis is also important to be able to dig deeper.  As we found some interesting points from the EDA, we also decided to create a shiny app, which would be useful for both Phish fans, and those who are new to the band.  We created two components, \'93Find a Show\'94 and \'93Show Map\'94, which allow users to create their own virtual concerts, and to explore past Phish shows locations and venues.  In conclusion, the three of us learned a lot from this project, from the different styles and specifics of R packages and coding to collaboration and communication in such a data-oriented project.  We were able to make use of what we learned in the course (STOR 390), along with researching online to complete the project.  }
